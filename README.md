# Python JSON Payload Generator

This Python script is a simple utility for generating JSON payloads and saving them to a local directory. It's a handy tool for generating sample JSON data for testing or for any other purpose.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `json_payload_generator.py` script to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you have the `json_payload_generator.py` script.

4. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python json_payload_generator.py
```

5. You will be prompted to enter the number of JSON payloads you want to generate and the directory where you want to save them.

6. The script will generate the JSON payloads and save them in the specified directory.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the JSON payload generator:

```bash
$ python json_payload_generator.py
Enter the number of JSON payloads to generate: 5
Enter the directory where you want to save the JSON payloads: output
JSON payloads generated and saved to 'output' directory.
```

In this example, 5 JSON payloads will be generated and saved in the 'output' directory.

## Customization

You can easily customize the script to generate JSON payloads with different structures or data by modifying the `generate_payload` function in the `json_payload_generator.py` script.

```python
def generate_payload():
    # Customize this function to generate your desired JSON payload
    payload = {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        # Add more key-value pairs as needed
    }
    return payload
```

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific needs.
